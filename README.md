# First React App
My first site on React with NodeJS server

# How to use it?

### Initialization

First, install NodeJS:
([Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/))

The **npm (node package manager)** program will be installed with it.

Then, being in the project root folder, run the npm-command: `npm ci`

This command automatically installed all the modules necessary for the application to work.

### Database

Server is using MySQL database. You can download it from the next link:
([MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))

Log into MySQL form command line and enter the contents of the file **help.sql**. 

It will configure your database to work with the server.

### Security

Put your key and certificate files to **/secure** folder in project root. HTTPS configuration guide below:
